Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera Mini, and Microsoft Edge are indeed different types of web browsers. 
Each browser comes with its own rendering engine, responsible for interpreting and displaying web content. 
These rendering engines vary in performance and features, leading to differences in how they handle JavaScript and other web technologies.

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. 
It is a syntax extension used primarily in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
JSX provides a way to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to describe and create components in React.

While JSX looks like HTML, it is not directly understood by browsers. 
Browsers can only execute regular JavaScript, not JSX. 
This is where Babel comes in. 
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts JSX code into plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all browsers.

So, the typical workflow for using JSX in React development involves writing JSX code during development, 
then using Babel to compile it into regular JavaScript that browsers can understand when deploying the application.

Each browser has its own engine responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript and other web technologies. For instance:

1. Chrome uses the V8 engine (developed by Google) - V8 is written in C++ and compiles JavaScript code into machine code, which makes it one of the fastest JavaScript engines available.
2. Firefox uses the SpiderMonkey engine - Also written in C++, SpiderMonkey was one of the first JavaScript engines and continues to be actively developed.
3. Opera Mini has its own Presto-based engine, optimized for mobile devices and designed to conserve data usage.
4. Microsoft Edge uses the Chakra engine (previously used in the legacy version) and has now switched to the Chromium-based engine, which also uses V8 (the same engine as Chrome).

All modern browsers support JavaScript as a fundamental language for frontend and backend development. 
However, it's worth noting that JavaScript is primarily used for frontend development to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces. 
For backend development, JavaScript is commonly used with Node.js, a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.
